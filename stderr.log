The most common\n      cases are IDE hard drives and ATAPI CD-ROM drives.\n\n      If your system is pure SCSI and doesn't use these interfaces, you\n      can say N here.\n\n      Integrated Disk Electronics (IDE aka ATA-1) is a connecting standard\n      for mass storage units such as hard disks. It was designed by\n      Western Digital and Compaq Computer in 1984. It was then named\n      ST506. Quite a number of disks use the IDE interface.\n\n      AT Attachment (ATA) is the superset of the IDE specifications.\n      ST506 was also called ATA-1.\n\n      Fast-IDE is ATA-2 (also named Fast ATA), Enhanced IDE (EIDE) is\n      ATA-3. It provides support for larger disks (up to 8.4GB by means of\n      the LBA standard), more disks (4 instead of 2) and for other mass\n      storage units such as tapes and cdrom. UDMA/33 (aka UltraDMA/33) is\n      ATA-4 and provides faster (and more CPU friendly) transfer modes\n      than previous PIO (Programmed processor Input/Output) from previous\n      ATA/IDE standards by means of fast DMA controllers.\n\n      ATA Packet Interface (ATAPI) is a protocol used by EIDE tape and\n      CD-ROM drives, similar in many respects to the SCSI protocol.\n\n      SMART IDE (Self Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) was\n      designed in order to prevent data corruption and disk crash by\n      detecting pre hardware failure conditions (heat, access time, and\n      the like...). Disks built since June 1995 may follow this standard.\n      The kernel itself don't manage this; however there are quite a\n      number of user programs such as smart that can query the status of\n      SMART parameters disk.\n\n      If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be\n      inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),\n      say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.
