-
-	  If your system is pure SCSI and doesn't use these interfaces, you

-
-	  Integrated Disk Electronics (IDE aka ATA-1) is a connecting standard
-	  for mass storage units such as hard disks. It was designed by
-	  Western Digital and Compaq Computer in 1984.  Quite a number of
-	  disks use the IDE interface.
-
-	  Fast-IDE is ATA-2 (also named Fast ATA), Enhanced IDE (EIDE) is
-	  ATA-3. It provides support for larger disks (up to 8.4GB by means of
-	  the LBA standard), more disks (4 instead of 2) and for other mass
-	  storage units such as tapes and cdrom. UDMA/33 (aka UltraDMA/33) is
-	  ATA-4 and provides faster (and more CPU friendly) transfer modes
-	  than previous PIO (Programmed processor Input/Output) from previous
-	  ATA/IDE standards by means of fast DMA controllers.
-
-	  ATA Packet Interface (ATAPI) is a protocol used by EIDE tape and
-	  CD-ROM drives, similar in many respects to the SCSI protocol.
-
-	  SMART IDE (Self Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) was
-	  designed in order to prevent data corruption and disk crash by
-	  detecting pre hardware failure conditions (heat, access time, and
-	  the like...). Disks built since June 1995 may follow this standard.
-	  The kernel itself don't manage this; however there are quite a
-	  number of user programs such as smart that can query the status of
-	  SMART parameters disk.
